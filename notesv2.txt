Create local project.

==============
PYCHARM SET UP
==============
Run / Edit Config / Defaults / Python / Command Line - so we can play with scripts after running.
File / Settings / Project Structure / Source - set up as source directory.

==============
VENV
==============
File / Settings / Project Interpreter / Create VirtualEnv - put venv subdirectory immediately beneath src root.
Managing the venv is now a lot easier - we can import any package: File / Settings / Project Interpreter / Plus Sign

Note that psycopg2 (for some reason) still has problems with importing (we saw it earlier pre-pycharm and same here);
Just copy across from Python27/lib/site-packages to venv/lib/site-packages.

Place requirements.txt beneath src root - tells the current interpreter (our venv) that it should contain
these packages making their update simple (just open a .py and look at banner top).
Just edit the pre-populated one supplied to suit.
(This file works with heroku also.)

==============
HEROKU
==============
Place procfile beneath src root - specific instructions to heroku. Edit the pre-populated file supplied.

==============
STRUCTURE
==============
Create gitignore directly beneath src root.
Use the intellij default and then tailor to, among other things, ignore the venv.
This will keep the github sync as small as possible.
(Place other gitignores under subdirectories as required.)

==============
INCLUDED DIRECTORIES
==============
ONE_OFFS
Create a one_offs directory (for stuff used in set up only say).
db_create_migrate and _init_data fit well here.

DEL_AREA
Temporary trash can. This will have its own gitignore to ignore_all in that subdirectory.

APP
Contains static and templates...

==============
MAIN FILES: CONFIG.PY, APP/INIT, RUN
==============
Don't forget to manually input the local database names!
Config for DB setting; __init__ for app and db creation (auto) when called by run.
